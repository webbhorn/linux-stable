How to use the helloKernel kernel module:
(taken from http://www.linuxchix.org/content/courses/kernel_hacking/lesson8 but in many places on the net)

1) Run make from this helloKernel folder as root. It'll use the Makefile in the folder.

2) Load your kernel module into the currently running kernel. Run

$ insmod hello.ko

3) This is the exciting step. Probably nothing has happened just yet, because helloKernel prints to the kernel log buffer. To check on that, run

$ dmesg | tail

and check to see if the "Hello, kernel!" message appears.

4) Unloading the module is also easy, just run

$ rmmod hello

You can check to see if it's been unloaded by doing step 3 again and looking for the "Cleaning up hello kernel module!" message.
